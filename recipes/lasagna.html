      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta
        but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and
        Parmesan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
        crusty garlic bread.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet
          until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until
          it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the
          parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly
          salted water until they're al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make the cheese layer:</strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan
          cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in
          a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Layer the ingredients according
          to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until
          the lasagna is assembled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the
          preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue
          baking until the top is golden brown.
        </li>
