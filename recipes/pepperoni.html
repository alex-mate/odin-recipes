      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch
          pizza pans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make sauce:</strong> Whisk together water, tomato paste,
          oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper
          in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make crust:</strong> Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and
          salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended,
          about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time,
          until a soft, sticky dough forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and
          elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using
          RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of
          dough onto the prepared pizza pans.
        </li>
        <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is
          bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom
          oven racks halfway through baking.
        </li>
