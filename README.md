# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.  
It is a simple recipe website built using basic HTML.

The goal of this project is to practice structuring a website with multiple pages
and linking them together using relative links.

## Project Description

The website consists of:

- A main index page that links to individual recipe pages
- Multiple recipe pages with text, images, and links
- A simple and clear folder structure for organizing files and assets

No CSS or JavaScript is used in this project. The focus is entirely on HTML structure
and correct usage of elements.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will demonstrate the ability to:

- Create a basic HTML website from scratch
- Use semantic HTML elements correctly
- Organize files and folders in a clear structure
- Add images using relative paths
- Create links between multiple pages
- Use Git and GitHub to track project progress with meaningful commits

## Future Improvements

In the future, this project can be expanded by:

- Adding CSS for styling
- Improving layout and typography
- Enhancing accessibility and structure
